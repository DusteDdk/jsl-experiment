```bash
node jsl.js ./test.json 42
```
Output:
```
The magic number is 41
Applied function result: 45
Applied function result: 3
The point is that the magic number is not zero...
the moot is point for the number is 41 and the number + 1 is: 42
Function myFunc called with argument a = 14 and argument b = 25
Adding them together yields 39
Function 'add' recursively adding [ [2,2], [1, [2,3]]]  = 10
